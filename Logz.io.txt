Pros:
Good support from Logz.io?

Cons:
Need to manually build and maintain the logstash-plugin. Logz.io forked the project to add logz.io support, but the plugin isn't up-to-date. The plugin is needed for build logs.

Filebeat for system logs

Seems like the build time is cummulative by build step. Each build step report the now total time of the build.
