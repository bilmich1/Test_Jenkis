Based on: https://logz.io/blog/jenkins-build-monitoring/

Pros:

Cons:
Need to manually build and maintain the logstash-plugin. Logz.io forked the project to add logz.io support, but the plugin isn't up-to-date.

Need to use logstash-plugin, which had incomplete and awful documentation (like the rest of Jenkins).
